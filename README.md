## üéØ Workshop Overview

This repository contains materials for the "Code an Ethical AI Study Buddy with Python" workshop for FutureHacks SEVEN 2025. The workshop introduces young hackers (ages 7-18) to AI concepts and ethics while building a simple AI study buddy using Python.

### ü§ñ What Participants Will Build

A Python-based AI study buddy that can:
- Answer questions about different school subjects
- Respond ethically to different types of requests
- Adapt to different learning styles
- Support rather than replace learning

## üìö Repository Contents

This repository includes:

- **`workshop.py`**: The complete Python code for the Ethical AI Study Buddy
- **`presentation.md`**: Slides for the workshop presentation (concept-focused)
- **`instructor_guide.md`**: Detailed guide for workshop facilitators
- **`participant_handout.md`**: Handout with key concepts and challenges

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Basic familiarity with running Python scripts
- No additional libraries required - the program uses only Python's standard library

### Running the AI Study Buddy

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ethical-ai-study-buddy.git
   cd ethical-ai-study-buddy
   ```

2. Run the Python script:
   ```
   python workshop.py
   ```

3. Interact with your AI study buddy by typing questions about math, science, history, or testing its ethical boundaries!

## üß† How It Works

The AI Study Buddy demonstrates several key concepts:

1. **Knowledge Organization**: Information is structured in a nested dictionary by subject and topic.
2. **Ethical Decision-Making**: The AI recognizes inappropriate requests and responds accordingly.
3. **Personalized Learning**: Different teaching approaches are used based on the question style.
4. **Natural Interaction**: Simple pattern matching creates a conversational experience.

## üë©‚Äçüè´ Workshop Structure (1 Hour)

1. **Introduction (10 minutes)**
   - Welcome and introduction to AI in education
   - Explanation of ethical considerations
   - Overview of what we'll build

2. **Concept Overview (15 minutes)**
   - How AI assistants work
   - Knowledge representation
   - Ethical boundaries in educational AI
   - Different learning approaches

3. **Coding Session (20 minutes)**
   - Walk through the code structure
   - Run the AI and test different questions
   - Make simple modifications

4. **Extension Activities (10 minutes)**
   - Add new knowledge to the AI
   - Enhance the ethical framework
   - Create new learning approaches

5. **Wrap-up & Hackathon Ideas (5 minutes)**
   - Review what we've learned
   - Ideas for expanding into hackathon projects
   - Q&A

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization Ideas

Participants can customize their AI Study Buddy by:

- Adding new subjects and topics to the knowledge base
- Creating more sophisticated ethical guidelines
- Implementing additional learning approaches
- Adding features like quizzes, hints, or memory of previous questions

## üèÜ FutureHacks Connection

This workshop aligns with the "Ethical AI in Education" theme of FutureHacks SEVEN 2025. Participants can:

- Use this starter code as the foundation for their hackathon project
- Work individually or with one teammate
- Focus on specific educational problems AI could help solve
- Emphasize ethical design in their solution

## üìã Age Adaptations

The workshop materials include adaptations for different age groups:

- **Ages 7-10**: Focus on modifying existing content and basic concepts
- **Ages 11-14**: Adding new features and understanding the ethical framework
- **Ages 15-18**: More advanced customization and deeper ethical discussions
